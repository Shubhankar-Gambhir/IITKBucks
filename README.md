# IITKBucks

This repo contains the main implementation of the application that i have built as a part of the summer project under the Programming Club,SnT Council, IIT Kanpur. It involved building a fully functional blockchain and aimed at learning the working of blockchains through building one of our own.

Running the program
To install all the libraries 
```
npm install
```
To run the server:
```
node Server/server.js
```
After running server

For making the process of geneating transactions, adding aliases, checking balance and generating keys easier i have built a command-line interaction program for user-friendly interaction with server.
To run it
```
node Server/interact.js
```

This is just the program of a single node and there would be various other similar nodes running their server.
